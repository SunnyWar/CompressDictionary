# English Dictionary Compression Project - CompressDictionary

## Overview
This GitHub project aims to explore the compression of the complete list of words in the English dictionary to achieve the smallest possible file size. The project will involve comparing the performance of various off-the-shelf compression libraries, NuGet compression libraries, and one or more custom compression schemes.

## Objectives
1. **Data Compression**: Implement and test different compression techniques to minimize the file size of the English dictionary word list.
2. **Library Comparison**: Evaluate the effectiveness of off-the-shelf compression libraries and NuGet compression libraries for this specific use case.
3. **Custom Compression Schemes**: Explore the development and application of custom compression algorithms tailored to the characteristics of the English dictionary.

## Technologies
The project will primarily use the following technologies:
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Unit Testing**: MSTest
- **Documentation Format**: XML for code header comments

## Project Structure
- **src**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **tests**: Houses the unit tests written using MSTest.
- **docs**: Documentation related to the project, including this readme.

## How to Contribute
If you're interested in contributing to the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the established coding and documentation standards.

Let's work together to push the boundaries of dictionary compression and find innovative solutions to reduce file sizes effectively!
